# antarcticR

Welcome to antarcticR ! a package that combines different environmental features of the Antarctic, such as ice shelves, antarctic continetal shelf and the seasonal sea ice distribution. 
It has a particular focus on the calving front dynamics along the antarctic coastline. 
The package provides a tool for accessing, analyzing and visualizing spatial data of this remote region, supporting research on ice sheet retreat and polar environmental change.
